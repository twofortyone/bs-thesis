This work intends to contribute to Distribution Networks to improve power supply quality 
and reliability throughout Service Restoration (SR) methodologies. By reviewing and comparing 
the existing SR methodologies, it is possible to identify the challenges and the limitations 
of the current methodologies, in order to develop a solution that attempts to overcome them.

In Chapter 1, the background and motivation of this work are presented. Additionally, and based on the 
identified challenges for SR improvements in distribution networks, the problem statement 
and research objectives are stated.

%This work intends to contribute to Service Resotarion techniques by developing an algorithm that improves the quality and reliability of distribution networks. By implementing Reinforcement Learning to create an agent capable of learning the best reconfiguration scheme feasible without violating DN constraints.As discussed in this thesis, Service Restoration. why is it important. However, successfully combining Machine Learning Techniques to reconfigure distribution networks is still an open research challenge.
