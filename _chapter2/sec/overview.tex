As mentioned before in Chapter 2, the Service Restoration algorithm must execute a Training scenario followed by a Production scenario to obtain a restoration plan. Nevertheless, Training and Production can be carried out independently, although the latter requires the Q Values matrix as input data.

To validate the effectiveness and performance of the SR algorithm, two different Distribution Networks provided by the IEEE Power and Energy Society (IEEE-PES) were tested.

In the following sections, the test cases are presented.
