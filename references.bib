abstract = {With the spotlight on smart grid development around the world, it is critical to recognize the key factors contributing to changing power system characteristics. This is more apparent in distribution systems with the integration of renewable energy sources, energy storage, and microgrid development. Utilities are also focusing on the reliability and resiliency of the grid. These activities require distribution automation (DA) strategies that take advantage of available technologies while promoting newer solutions. It is necessary to create a roadmap for holistic DA strategies in a smarter grid. Sustainable and resilient grid development is a paradigm shift requiring a new line of thinking in the engineering, operation, and maintenance of the power system. International perspectives on DA are also addressed, with the understanding that one solution will not fit all. Integrating technical, business, and policy decisions into the challenges will generate the development of technologies, standards, and implementation of the overall solution. The challenges in the development of industry standards are also discussed. This paper explores the challenges and opportunities in the changing landscape of the distribution systems. Evolution of technologies and the business case for infrastructure investment in distribution systems are covered in another paper by the same authors.},

abstract = {Distribution network reconfiguration (DNR) can significantly reduce power losses, improve the voltage profile, and increase the power quality. DNR studies require implementation of power flow analysis and complex optimization procedures capable of handling large combinatorial problems. The size of distribution network influences the type of the optimization method to be applied. Straightforward approaches can be computationally expensive or even prohibitive whereas heuristic or meta-heuristic approaches can yield acceptable results with less computation cost. In this paper, a customized evolutionary algorithm has been introduced and applied to power distribution network reconfiguration. The recombination operators of the algorithm are designed to preserve feasibility of solutions (radial structure of the network) thus considerably reducing the size of the search space. Consequently, improved repeatability of results as well as lower overall computational complexity of the optimization process have been achieved. The optimization process considers power losses and the system voltage profile, both aggregated into a scalar cost function. Power flow analysis is performed with the Open Distribution System Simulator, a simple and efficient simulation tool for electric distribution systems. Our approach is demonstrated using several networks of various sizes. Comprehensive benchmarking indicates superiority of the proposed technique over state-of-the-art methods from the literature.},

@article{Mnih2015,
abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account, deeply rooted in psychological and neuroscientific perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.},

@article{Zhang2019,
abstract = {Recent years have witnessed significant advances in reinforcement learning (RL), which has registered great success in solving various sequential decision-making problems in machine learning. Most of the successful RL applications, e.g., the games of Go and Poker, robotics, and autonomous driving, involve the participation of more than one single agent, which naturally fall into the realm of multi-agent RL (MARL), a domain with a relatively long history, and has recently re-emerged due to advances in single-agent RL techniques. Though empirically successful, theoretical foundations for MARL are relatively lacking in the literature. In this chapter, we provide a selective overview of MARL, with focus on algorithms backed by theoretical analysis. More specifically, we review the theoretical results of MARL algorithms mainly within two representative frameworks, Markov/stochastic games and extensive-form games, in accordance with the types of tasks they address, i.e., fully cooperative, fully competitive, and a mix of the two. We also introduce several significant but challenging applications of these algorithms. Orthogonal to the existing reviews on MARL, we highlight several new angles and taxonomies of MARL theory, including learning in extensive-form games, decentralized MARL with networked agents, MARL in the mean-field regime, (non-)convergence of policy-based methods for learning in games, etc. Some of the new angles extrapolate from our own research endeavors and interests. Our overall goal with this chapter is, beyond providing an assessment of the current state of the field on the mark, to identify fruitful future research directions on theoretical studies of MARL. We expect this chapter to serve as continuing stimulus for researchers interested in working on this exciting while challenging topic.},

The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.},

@article{Wu2018,
abstract = {With the widespread application of distributed renewable energy in power systems, energy management problems in micro-grids have become increasingly significant. Offline or static optimization methods are frequently employed to solve the problems which are typically discrete and nonlinear. There are few online optimization methods and they are not only complex but also normally consider the distributed generations and loads in micro-grid as a whole. The outcome is that the online methods fail to reflect the composing characteristic of distributed multi-energy and the contribution made by developing renewable energy to reduce the consumption of traditional fossil energy. Moreover, results obtained by either the offline or the on-line methods can deviate to certain extents from the true values. This paper treats the management of distributed energy in micro-grids as an optimal control problem. Using the system control theory, a framework of real-time management of distributed energy in micro-grids is proposed. A deep learning adaptive dynamic programming is proposed for this framework. Due to the introduction of the concept of closed-loop feedback, the proposed management and control strategy is a real-time algorithm. Furthermore, the accuracy of managing and controlling the objective function can be improved. The gap of the flexible load after the optimization can be helpful in terms of guiding the flexible load consumers to change their habits of energy consumption, thereby reducing the coal-fired power generation and providing room for reducing carbon emissions. Because it is real-time, micro-grid operators can also realize intra-day scheduling, which can be done through combining this optimized management and control strategy with the mechanism of energy operating and managing. Moreover, some data sets of the real-time optimal control strategy are obtained in this paper. These intuitive and accurate data sets can be used to further optimize energy operating and managing of micro-grids, thereby realizing effective energy management for micro-grids. Finally, the real-time and effectiveness of the proposed management and control strategy are proved by the simulations. Some positive conclusions are drawn.},

abstract = {Reliability of power distribution systems is of very crucial concern due to cases of mass power outages that occur worldwide. Once an unscheduled outage takes place in power grids, the service restoration is triggered to rapidly return the system to normal conditions and minimize the severity of consequences. This paper proposes a self-healing power distribution grid restoration technique based on decentralized multi-agent systems with reinforcement learning. The system architecture is based on two types of zone agents: Inactive Zone Agent (IZA) and Active Zone Agent (AZA), where the IZA is activated provided that an agent is within the out-of-service area. This study contributes to the advancement of service restoration by endowing agents with learning ability. The reward computation proposed in this paper is based on the load priority factor, and also it ensures preserving the constraints within the limits. Case studies include a comparison of service restoration outcomes with load priority factor and DGs incorporated into the network. All simulations are implemented in the PowerWorld simulator for the medium voltage network of 11kV with 29 buses. The results of the study prove that embedding Q-learning algorithm into service restoration significantly improves the performance metrics and thus, increases the reliability of the distribution grids.},

The suppliers and consumers of electricity are modeled as autonomous agents, capable of making local decisions in order to maximize their own profit in a multiagent environment. For every supplier, a lack of information about customers and other suppliers creates challenges to optimal decision making in order to maximize its return. Similarly, customers face difficulty in scheduling their energy consumption without any information about suppliers and electricity prices. Additionally, there are several uncertainties involved in the nature of MGs due to variability in renewable generation output power and continuous fluctuation of customers' consumption. In order to prevail over these challenges, a reinforcement learning algorithm was developed to allow generation resources, distributed storages, and customers to develop optimal strategies for energy management and load scheduling without prior information about each other and the MG system. Case studies are provided to show how the overall performance of all entities converges as an emergent behavior to the Nash equilibrium, benefiting all agents.},

A feature of the smart grid is a system self-recovery capability in the occurrence of anomalies, such as a recovery of a power distribution network after an occurrence of a fault. When this system has a capacity for self-recovery, it is called self-healing. The intersection among areas as computer science, telecommunication, automation and electrical engineering, has allowed power systems to gain new technologies. However, because it is a multi-area domain, self-recovery simulation tools in smart grids are often highly complex as well as presenting low fidelity by using approximation algorithms. The main contribution of this paper is a simulator with high fidelity and low complexity in terms of programming, usability and semantics. In this simulator, a computational intelligence technique and a derivative method for calculating the power flow were encapsulated.

abstract = {Efficient and valuable strategies provided by large amount of available data are urgently needed for a sustainable electricity system that includes smart grid technologies and very complex power system situations. Big Data technologies including Big Data management and utilization based on increasingly collected data from every component of the power grid are crucial for the successful deployment and monitoring of the system. This paper reviews the key technologies of Big Data management and intelligent machine learning methods for complex power systems. Based on a comprehensive study of power system and Big Data, several challenges are summarized to unlock the potential of Big Data technology in the application of smart grid. This paper proposed a modified and optimized structure of the Big Data processing platform according to the power data sources and different structures. Numerous open-sourced Big Data analytical tools and software are integrated as modules of the analytic engine, and self-developed advanced algorithms are also designed. The proposed framework comprises a data interface, a Big Data management, analytic engine as well as the applications, and display module. To fully investigate the proposed structure, three major applications are introduced: development of power grid topology and parallel computing using CIM files, high-efficiency load-shedding calculation, and power system transmission line tripping analysis using 3D visualization. The real-system cases demonstrate the effectiveness and great potential of the Big Data platform; therefore, data resources can achieve their full potential value for strategies and decision-making for smart grid. The proposed platform can provide a technical solution to the multidisciplinary cooperation of Big Data technology and smart grid monitoring.},

abstract = {The increasing penetration of renewable generation poses several challenges to the operation of distribution networks under emergency conditions. This study proposes a service restoration method that exploits active management of the distribution network. The proposed active network management (ANM) method considers the coordinated control of the available switches, distributed generation, and the operation of on-load tap changer (OLTC) to determine the optimal service restoration plan. The objectives of the proposed model are the minimisation of (i) the out of service area considering customer priorities, (ii) the number of switch operations, (iii) the number of tap changes of the OLTC, and (iv) the injected power from the substations considering the variation of load demand and renewable generation. The service restoration problem is formulated as a mixed-integer second-order cone programming problem, which is efficiently solved by commercial branch and bound solvers. Results on a 135-bus distribution system and a 540-bus distribution system highlight the importance and the benefits of incorporating ANM into the solution of the service restoration problem.},

abstract = {This paper presents a survey of recent development in Fault Localisation and Service Restoration (FLSR) following electrical disturbance in Power Distribution Systems (PDS) based on distributed approaches. Distributed approaches have been found to fit well in the distribution systems as they have more than one decision-making component, and data processing can be done in parallel in individual units that makes it faster and requires less processing capabilities centrally. Recently reported distributed approaches have been studied and analysed. With ever-growing integration of the renewable distributed generation (DG) into the distribution systems, it has been realised that, the uncertainty nature of both load demand and DG need to be considered in the service restoration problems for improved efficiency. Consideration of uncertainty nature of the renewable generation and load demands in the distributed FLSR result into the increased restored customers as well as avoiding overloading and underloading after restoration. The paper starts with a general overview of the Multi Agent Systems (MAS) as the distributed control approach and approaches for forecasting load demand and DG power and then discusses different approaches used for FLSR in PDS by showing their strengths and limitations. The review is concluded by giving future research directions.},

abstract = {Microgrids can act as emergency sources to serve critical loads when utility power is unavailable. This paper proposes a resiliency-based methodology that uses microgrids to restore critical loads on distribution feeders after a major disaster. Due to limited capacity of distributed generators (DGs) within microgrids, dynamic performance of the DGs during the restoration process becomes essential. In this paper, the stability of microgrids, limits on frequency deviation, and limits on transient voltage and current of DGs are incorporated as constraints of the critical load restoration problem. The limits on the amount of generation resources within microgrids are also considered. By introducing the concepts of restoration tree and load group, restoration of critical loads is transformed into a maximum coverage problem, which is a linear integer program (LIP). The restoration paths and actions are determined for critical loads by solving the LIP. A 4-feeder, 1069-bus unbalanced test system with four microgrids is utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The method is applied to the distribution system in Pullman, WA, resulting in a strategy that uses generators on the Washington State University campus to restore service to the Hospital and City Hall in Pullman.},

There are different approaches of Advanced Distribution Automation (ADA) that allows a better monitoring and control of the electrical grids, making it able to take automatic decisions. One of these approaches regards on subroutines using conditional logics at the SCADA system level, in order to accomplish fast and automatic load transfer considering remotely controlled reclosers placed along the defective feeder (Normally Closed reclosers) and between neighboring feeders (Normally Opened reclosers). Such ADA approach was evaluated in a Smart Grid laboratory, where the systemic environment of a power distribution company was reproduced.

The system comprises of smart terminal units (STUs) installed in substation circuit breakers and sectionalising switches. The STUs are connected together through a peer-to-peer communication network using industrial Ethernet. The STUs detect fault and exchange fault data and control commands with each other to realise FLISR without reliance on the central master station. Details of the control algorithm are presented in this study. Successful service restoration requires self-recognition of the normally open tie switch, the position of which may change due to network reconfiguration. This technique is also presented.

Like many other distribution utilities in the world, TNB distribution system did have automation system at that time, so in order to implement automation system; it is needed to modify the existing distribution configuration. This is done so to replicate the Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) distribution system and modify this system to suit distribution automation system operation mechanism. Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) and Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) along power line communication (PLC) system have been used for monitoring and operating the distribution system. TNB distribution system is based on an open loop distribution system for that reason the open loop distribution system has been adopted to implement the actual distribution configuration system. This research is the first DAS research work done on customer based substation for operating and controlling between the consumer side system and the substation at the TNB side in automated manner.

The paper proposes an event driven finite-state machine design that assures the self-reconfiguration of the distribution power grid when a fault occurs on a certain section of a feeder. The benefits of such an approach are first of all the modularity, as each breaker is controlled by the same algorithm and requires data exchange only with the neighboring protection devices. Secondly, by using the event driven technique, the FLISR algorithm is perfectly suited for taking advantage of the features and benefits defined by the IEC 61850 protocol. Using GOOSE messages for transferring status information between the neighboring circuit breakers, the proposed distributed algorithms act in a collective manner for reconfiguring the distribution grid.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a multi-agent approach to decentralized power system restoration for distribution system networks. The proposed method consists of several Distributing Substation Agents (DSAGs) and Load Agents (LAGs). LAG corresponds to the customer load, while a DSAG corresponds to the distribution substation. LAG restores self-load, while a DSAG supplies the electricity to LAGs. From the simulation results, it can be seen the proposed multi-agent system could reach the right solution by making use of only the local information. In addition, the proposed method is able to get the restorative plan which is better than the solution of the mixed integer programming. Therefore, the interaction of several simple agents leads to a dynamic restoration system, allowing approximation solution efficiently. This means that the proposed multi-agent restoration system is a promising approach to more large-scale distribution networks. {\textcopyright} 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

A suitable evaluation of switch indices is used for all candidate tie switches (TSs) in the network to find the best solution and decrease the number of switching operations. A new graph-based approach is utilized for finding the best sectionalizes switch (SS) and minimizing the voltage drop. The accuracy and the validity of the approach are tested in two standard electrical distribution networks. The results of the approach are used for IEEE 69-bus and IEEE 119-bus test case.},

abstract = {To improve safety, reliability, and efﬁciency of automotive vehicles and other technical applications, embedded systems commonly use fault diagnosis consisting of fault detection and isolation. Since many systems are constructed as distributed embedded systems including multiple control units, it is necessary to perform global fault isolation using for example a central unit. However, the drawbacks with such a centralized method are the need of a powerful diagnostic unit and the sensitivity against disconnections of this unit. Two alternative methods to centralized fault isolation arepresented in this thesis. The ﬁrst method performs global fault isolation by a distributed sequential computation. For a set of studied systems, the method gives, compared to a centralized method, a mean reduction in maximum processor load on any unit with 40 and 70 % for systems consisting of four and eight units respectively. The second method instead extends the result of the local fault isolation performed in each unit such that the results are globally correct. By only considering the components affecting each speciﬁc unit, the extended result in each agent is kept small. For a studied automotive vehicle, the second method gives, compared to a centralized method, a mean reduction in the sizes of the results and the maximum processor load on any unit with 85 and 90 % respectively. To perform fault diagnosis, diagnostic tests are commonly used. If the additional evaluation of tests can not improve the fault isolation of a component then the component is ready. Since the evaluation of a test comes with a cost in for example computational resources, it is valuable to minimize the number of tests that have to be evaluated before readiness is achieved for all components. A strategy is presented that decides in which order to evaluate tests such that readiness is achieved with as few evaluations of tests as possible. Besides knowing how fault diagnosis is performed, it is also interesting to assess the effect that fault diagnosis has on for example safety. Since fault tree analysis often is used to evaluate safety, this thesis contributes with a systematic method that includes the effect of fault diagnosis in fault trees. The safety enhancement due to the use of fault diagnosis can thereby be analyzed and quantiﬁed.},

abstract = {The design of Medium Voltage (MV) Overhead Lines (OHL) is often radial in nature which makes back-feeding difficult and these networks are often long which increases their exposure to faults. This has resulted in poor network reliability. Customers are mainly affected by faults on the MV network, to which particular attention has to be paid. Permanent faults (involving equipment damage) have negative impact on customers since they experience outages or interruptions while the equipment is repaired or replaced. The impact on customers increases when these outages are long. Customers continue to demand higher levels of uninterrupted supply from the distribution network; therefore it is necessary to implement self-healing Smart Grid technologies. One such technique is Fault Location, Isolation and Service Restoration (FLISR). The main drive towards implementing FLISR is to improve Eskom's network performance, increase electricity sales, improve flexibility and reduce the impact on the economy of outages. This paper discusses various ways to implement FLISR and will also focus on case studies on real distribution networks and look at the issues associated with closing a remotely controlled or automatically operated Normally Open (N/O) point for back-feeding.

abstract = {When a major outage occurs on a distribution system due to extreme events, microgrids, distributed generators, and other local resources can be used to restore critical loads and enhance resiliency. This paper proposes a decision-making method to determine the optimal restoration strategy coordinating multiple sources to serve critical loads after blackouts. The critical load restoration problem is solved by a two-stage method with the first stage deciding the post-restoration topology and the second stage determining the set of loads to be restored and the outputs of sources. In the second stage, the problem is formulated as a mixed-integer semidefinite program. The objective is maximizing the number of loads restored, weighted by their priority. The unbalanced three-phase power flow constraint and operational constraints are considered. An iterative algorithm is proposed to deal with integer variables and can attain the global optimum of the critical load restoration problem by solving a few semidefinite programs under two conditions. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by numerical simulation with the modified IEEE 13-node test feeder and the modified IEEE 123-node test feeder under plenty of scenarios. The results indicate that the optimal restoration strategy can be determined efficiently in most scenarios.},

abstract = {Medium Voltage (MV) Overhead Lines (OHL) are normally designed in a radial nature which results in back-feeding challenges. MV feeders are usually long in length and that exposes them a huge deal to faults. Major attention has to be paid to these networks since they create faults which affect customers. It is therefore essential to develop self-healing Smart Grid technologies to improve the performance of these networks and to ensure minimum customer interruption during an outage. One such technology is Fault Location, Isolation and Service Restoration (FLISR). The key motivation of implementing FLISR is to advance the utility's network reliability. This paper addresses ways to implement FLISR and it focuses on a real distribution network case study and it looks at the issues associated with closing a remotely controlled or automatically operated Normally Open (N/O) point for back-feeding purposes. The benefits of implementing an automated service restoration to Eskom are to minimize the number of customers affected by a fault by automatically isolating the faulted location and restoring service to the healthy portion of customers. This will ultimately minimize the number of customer-hours interrupted (SAIDI) to the values required by the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA).},

The framework is composed of two phases: In the first phase a probabilistic neural network is trained with the eigenvalues of voltage data collected during symmetrical and unsymmetrical fault disturbances. The eigenvalues are computed from the correlation matrix built from historical data, and are used as neural network inputs. The neural network is able to carry out a first classification/discrimination process of nodes states, obtaining in this way a reduction on data analysis. In the second phase a sample magnitude comparison is used to detect and locate the presence of a fault. A set of simulations are carried out over an electrical power system to show the performance of the proposed framework and a comparison is made against a diagnostic system based on probabilistic logic.},

abstract = {Network reconfiguration for service restoration (SR) in distribution systems is a complex optimization problem. For large-scale distribution systems, it is computationally hard to find adequate SR plans in real time since the problem is combinatorial and non-linear, involving several constraints and objectives. Two Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms that use Node-Depth Encoding (NDE) have proved able to efficiently generate adequate SR plans for large distribution systems: (i) one of them is the hybridization of the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) with NDE, named NSGA-N; (ii) the other is a Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on subpopulation tables that uses NDE, named MEAN. Further challenges are faced now, i.e. the design of SR plans for larger systems as good as those for relatively smaller ones and for multiple faults as good as those for one fault (single fault). In order to tackle both challenges, this paper proposes a method that results from the combination of NSGA-N, MEAN and a new heuristic. Such a heuristic focuses on the application of NDE operators to alarming network zones according to technical constraints. The method generates similar quality SR plans in distribution systems of significantly different sizes (from 3860 to 30,880 buses). Moreover, the number of switching operations required to implement the SR plans generated by the proposed method increases in a moderate way with the number of faults. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Outage detection is the first and foremost step in the electric power distribution outage management system (OMS). Unplanned outage detection is very important for improving the distribution system reliability and accessibility. Traditionally, customers' trouble calls are the primary source of outage notification. However, customers report only one third of outages in the first hour of outages. The advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) could send outage notifications almost instantly to the utility and could also give restoration notification when power is restored. AMI data may be corrupted due to communication channel noise and there may also be unnecessary outage notifications due to the temporary outages. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed to filter out the meter notifications due to corrupted data and temporary outages of duration less than one minute. An AMI data filter is modelled by probabilistic and fuzzy membership functions to remove the corrupted data. Integration of distribution supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system with AMI for outage location finding is also proposed by fuzzy membership function based model. Proposed models have been tested on a radial distribution test feeder and results are analysed.},

The proposed control structure has two layers: zone and feeder. The function of zone agents in the first layer is monitoring, making simple calculations, and implementing control actions. Feeder agents in the second layer are assigned to negotiation. The constraints include voltage limits, line current limits, and radial topology. Load variation has been taken into consideration to avoid the need for further reconfigurations during the restoration period.

Knowing the voltage sag characteristics, it is possible to locate the faulty node or the faulty area of the feeder. This voltage-based approach ensures the efficiency and robustness of the algorithm, which provides suitable and accurate results. An overhead, three-phase, three-wire, 13.8 kV, 134-node, real-life feeder model is used to evaluate the algorithm.

Further best features are selected from the total feature set by forward feature selection method. These selected features are then fed as input to the artificial neural network for fault location. In the proposed method, the simulation conditions for the test pattern are completely different from the train one in order to make it robust. Simulation result shows that the proposed hybrid fault location method gives high accuracy for the distribution system.},

Though the three topics are highly correlated, the authors try to discuss them separately, so that one may have a more logical and comprehensive understanding of the concepts without getting confused. Great significance is also attached to the feature extraction process, without which the majority of the methods may not be implemented properly. Fault detection techniques are discussed on the basis of feature extraction. After the overall concepts and general ideas are presented, representative works as well as new progress in the techniques are covered and discussed in detail. One may find the content of this study helpful as a detailed literature review or a practical technical guidance.},

abstract = {Diverse fault types, fast re-closures, and complicated transient states after a fault event make real-time fault location in power grids challenging. Existing localization techniques in this area rely on simplistic assumptions, such as static loads, or require much higher sampling rates or total measurement availability. This paper proposes a faulted line localization method based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier using bus voltages. Unlike prior data-driven methods, the proposed classifier is based on features with physical interpretations that improve the robustness of the location performance. The accuracy of our CNN based localization tool is demonstrably superior to other machine learning classifiers in the literature. To further improve the location performance, a joint phasor measurement units (PMU) placement strategy is proposed and validated against other methods. A significant aspect of our methodology is that under very low observability (7% of buses), the algorithm is still able to localize the faulted line to a small neighborhood with high probability. The performance of our scheme is validated through simulations of faults of various types in the IEEE 39-bus and 68-bus power systems under varying uncertain conditions, system observability, and measurement quality.},

abstract = {This paper develops a novel graph convolutional network (GCN) framework for fault location in power distribution networks. The proposed approach integrates multiple measurements at different buses while taking system topology into account. The effectiveness of the GCN model is corroborated by the IEEE 123 bus benchmark system. Simulation results show that the GCN model significantly outperforms other widely-used machine learning schemes with very high fault location accuracy. In addition, the proposed approach is robust to measurement noise and data loss errors. Data visualization results of two competing neural networks are presented to explore the mechanism of GCNs superior performance. A data augmentation procedure is proposed to increase the robustness of the model under various levels of noise and data loss errors. Further experiments show that the model can adapt to topology changes of distribution networks and perform well with a limited number of measured buses.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a communication-assisted fault localization, isolation, and restoration method for microgrids based on a multi-agent system. The proposed system comprises distributed agents, located in the middle and at the two ends of a protection section, which will detect a fault through phase angle comparison of current signals at both sides of a given distribution line. The agents then send trips signal to corresponding circuit breakers accordingly. The importance of the proposed protection technique is twofold. First, it eliminates the use of voltage transformers and thus reduces costs. Second, it does not require transfer of data along long distances, which decreases the delay time for fault isolation. Power restoration processes following the fault clearance considering voltage, frequency, and power flow constraints in the microgrid under study were also performed. Simulation of the proposed protection methodology was presented followed by experimental verification. The experimental results showed excellent agreement with the simulated protection scheme.},

Smart Grid Architecture Model offers a support to design such emerging use cases by representing interoperability aspects among component, function, communication, information, and business layers. To allow this kind of interoperability analysis for design and implementation of Fault Detection, Isolation and Restoration function in outage management systems, we develop an Internet-of-Things-based platform to perform real time co-simulations. Physical components of the grid are modeled in Opal-RT real time simulator, an automated Fault Detection, Isolation and Restoration algorithm is developed in MATLAB and an MQTT communication has been adopted. A 2-feeder MV network with a normally open switch for reconfiguration is modeled to realize the performance of the developed co-simulation platform.},
